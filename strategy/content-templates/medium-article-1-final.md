If you've ever Googled "is Diet Cherry Coke discontinued," you're not alone. For years, fans of this iconic zero-calorie cherry cola have been searching store shelves, posting on Reddit, and calling Coca-Cola's customer service line — all trying to track down their favorite drink.

The good news? Diet Cherry Coke is back. And this time, it looks like it's here to stay.

### A Brief History of Diet Cherry Coke

Diet Cherry Coke first hit shelves in 1986, just one year after Coca-Cola introduced Cherry Coke to the market. It was an instant hit with diet soda drinkers who wanted that signature cherry flavor without the calories.

Over the decades, the drink went through several name changes and formula tweaks. It was briefly rebranded as "Diet Coke Cherry" in some markets, and availability became increasingly spotty after 2018. By 2020, many fans assumed it had been quietly discontinued.

But Coca-Cola never officially pulled the plug. Instead, Diet Cherry Coke became what industry insiders call a "ghost SKU" — technically still in production, but nearly impossible to find in most regions. The pandemic-era aluminum can shortage made things even worse, as Coca-Cola prioritized its best-selling products.

### The Comeback

Starting in late 2024, Diet Cherry Coke began reappearing on store shelves across the United States. Fans on social media were the first to notice, posting excited photos of their finds at Walmart, Target, and local grocery stores.

Coca-Cola confirmed the expanded distribution in early 2025, citing "overwhelming consumer demand" as the driving force. The company noted that Diet Cherry Coke had become one of its most-requested products through its customer feedback channels.

If you're wondering whether your local store carries it, I put together a [detailed store-by-store guide](https://dietcherrycoke.net/where-to-buy) that covers availability at major retailers including Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.

### What Does It Taste Like?

For the uninitiated, Diet Cherry Coke delivers a distinctive flavor profile that sets it apart from other diet sodas. The cherry flavoring is subtle but present — not the artificial, medicinal cherry taste you might expect. It blends smoothly with the classic Diet Coke base, creating something that tastes more like a cherry cola than a flavored diet soda.

How does it compare to the competition? Cherry Coke Zero Sugar is the most obvious rival, using Coca-Cola's Zero Sugar formula instead of the classic Diet Coke base. Dr Pepper Cherry Zero is another popular alternative, though it brings a completely different flavor profile to the table.

I've done a [side-by-side comparison of Diet Cherry Coke vs Cherry Coke Zero](https://dietcherrycoke.net/compare/diet-cherry-coke-vs-coke-zero-cherry) if you're curious about the differences. Short version: they're more different than you'd think.

### Why Fans Are So Passionate

Diet Cherry Coke has one of the most dedicated fan bases in the soda world. There are entire Reddit threads, Facebook groups, and Twitter accounts devoted to tracking its availability. Some fans have driven hours to stock up when they find it in stores.

Part of this passion comes from nostalgia. For many people, Diet Cherry Coke is tied to specific memories — college study sessions, road trips, family gatherings. When it disappeared from shelves, it felt like losing a small but meaningful piece of their daily routine.

But there's also something about the flavor itself. Diet Cherry Coke occupies a unique niche that no other product quite fills. Cherry Coke Zero comes close, but longtime fans insist the original diet version has a smoother, more balanced taste.

### Making the Most of It

Now that Diet Cherry Coke is back, fans are finding creative ways to enjoy it beyond just drinking it straight from the can. Cherry cola floats, dirty Diet Cherry Coke (with coconut cream and lime), and even cherry cola cocktails have become popular on social media.

If you're looking for inspiration, there's a growing collection of [Diet Cherry Coke recipes](https://dietcherrycoke.net/recipes) that range from simple floats to elaborate mixed drinks. The dirty coke variation, in particular, has been trending on TikTok.

### The Bottom Line

Diet Cherry Coke's return is a win for soda fans everywhere. Whether you're a longtime devotee who's been searching for years, or someone who's just curious about what all the fuss is about, now is the perfect time to grab a can.

The drink is available at most major retailers, though availability can still vary by region. Your best bet is to check your local Walmart or Target first, or order online through Amazon or Coca-Cola's website.

Welcome back, Diet Cherry Coke. We missed you.
