Coca-Cola has gone through several rounds of discontinuations over the past few years. The biggest wave was in late 2020, when they cut about 200 brands as part of a portfolio streamlining effort. The most notable ones included Tab (the original diet cola from the 1960s), Zico Coconut Water, Odwalla juices, and Coca-Cola Life.

They also quietly pulled some regional and niche flavors like Diet Coke Feisty Cherry, Northern Neck Ginger Ale, and Delaware Punch. The idea was to focus on their core brands that actually drive sales volume.

One product that a lot of people thought was discontinued is Diet Cherry Coke. It became really hard to find in stores around 2021-2022, and there were tons of threads online from people panicking about it. Turns out it wasn't officially discontinued — it just had limited distribution in certain regions. It's still being produced and you can find it at most major retailers, though availability varies by location. I found a pretty thorough guide on where to buy it at dietcherrycoke.net that lists current retailers and stock info.

As of now, Coca-Cola seems to be done with the major cuts. They're focusing more on innovation with new flavors (like the Creations line) rather than trimming the portfolio further.
