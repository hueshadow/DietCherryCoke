## Taste Comparison

Diet Cherry Coke and Cherry Coke share the same cherry cola concept, but the taste experience is noticeably different. **Cherry Coke** is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, which gives it a rich, full-bodied sweetness that coats the palate. The cherry flavor in regular Cherry Coke is bold and syrupy, blending seamlessly with the classic Coca-Cola base to create a drink that tastes like a cherry-topped fountain soda.

**Diet Cherry Coke**, on the other hand, is built on the Diet Coke formula and sweetened with aspartame. The result is a lighter, crisper beverage with a cleaner finish. The cherry flavor in Diet Cherry Coke is more subtle and balanced — it complements the cola rather than dominating it. Some drinkers describe it as a more "refined" cherry taste compared to the candy-like sweetness of regular Cherry Coke.

If you grew up drinking regular Cherry Coke, the diet version will taste noticeably different at first. The absence of sugar changes the mouthfeel significantly. Diet Cherry Coke has a thinner body and a slightly dry finish, while Cherry Coke feels heavier and more viscous on the tongue. However, many longtime Diet Coke fans find that Diet Cherry Coke tastes perfectly natural and even preferable to the sugary original.

The carbonation levels are similar in both versions, delivering that satisfying fizz that cherry cola fans expect. Served ice-cold, both drinks are refreshing, but the lighter profile of Diet Cherry Coke can actually feel more thirst-quenching on a hot day.

## Nutrition Comparison

This is where the biggest difference between Diet Cherry Coke and Cherry Coke becomes impossible to ignore. The nutritional gap between these two drinks is enormous:

- **Calories**: Diet Cherry Coke has **0 calories** vs Cherry Coke's **150 calories** per 12 oz can
- **Sugar**: Diet Cherry Coke has **0g sugar** vs Cherry Coke's **39g sugar** (nearly 10 teaspoons)
- **Total Carbohydrates**: Diet Cherry Coke has **0g** vs Cherry Coke's **39g**
- **Sodium**: Diet Cherry Coke has approximately **40mg** vs Cherry Coke's **45mg**
- **Caffeine**: Diet Cherry Coke has **46mg** vs Cherry Coke's **34mg**
- **Sweetener**: Diet Cherry Coke uses **aspartame**; Cherry Coke uses **high-fructose corn syrup**

For anyone watching their calorie or sugar intake, the numbers speak for themselves. Drinking one can of Cherry Coke per day adds up to over 1,000 calories and 273 grams of sugar per week. Switching to Diet Cherry Coke eliminates all of that while still delivering the cherry cola flavor you enjoy.

It is worth noting that Diet Cherry Coke contains slightly more caffeine than regular Cherry Coke. The 46mg per can in Diet Cherry Coke compared to 34mg in Cherry Coke is a modest difference, but caffeine-sensitive individuals should be aware of it.

## Price Comparison

Diet Cherry Coke and Cherry Coke are priced very similarly at most retailers. Since both products come from Coca-Cola and share the same distribution channels, you can expect comparable pricing:

- **12-pack cans**: Diet Cherry Coke $5.98–$7.99 vs Cherry Coke $5.48–$7.49
- **20 oz bottle**: Both typically $2.19–$2.99
- **2-liter bottle**: Both typically $1.98–$3.49

During the initial relaunch period, Diet Cherry Coke may carry a very slight premium at some retailers, but the price difference is negligible. Both products frequently go on sale, and buying in bulk from warehouse stores like Costco or Sam's Club can bring the per-can cost down significantly.

When you factor in the health costs of consuming 39 grams of sugar per serving, Diet Cherry Coke arguably offers better long-term value even at the same price point.

## Availability

Cherry Coke has been a staple on store shelves for decades and enjoys widespread availability across the United States. You can find it at virtually every grocery store, convenience store, gas station, and vending machine.

Diet Cherry Coke is currently rolling out to major retailers following its 2026 relaunch. Availability is expanding rapidly, and you can already find it at Walmart, Kroger, Target, and Amazon. However, some smaller retailers and convenience stores may not carry it yet.
