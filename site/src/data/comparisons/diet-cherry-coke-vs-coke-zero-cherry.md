## Taste Comparison

The most important difference between Diet Cherry Coke and Coke Zero Cherry comes down to their base formulas. Diet Cherry Coke is built on the **Diet Coke** formula, which has a lighter, crisper taste with a distinctive "diet" flavor that millions of fans love. Coke Zero Cherry, on the other hand, uses the **Coke Zero Sugar** formula, which aims to taste more like regular Coca-Cola.

When it comes to the cherry flavor, Diet Cherry Coke delivers a **medium-intensity cherry** that blends naturally with the Diet Coke base. It's subtle enough to complement the cola without overpowering it. Coke Zero Cherry has a **milder cherry flavor** that can sometimes get lost in the stronger cola base.

For longtime Diet Coke drinkers, Diet Cherry Coke feels like a natural extension of their favorite drink. For those who prefer the taste of regular Coke, Coke Zero Cherry may feel more familiar.

## Nutrition Comparison

Both beverages are zero-calorie and sugar-free, but there are some differences worth noting:

- **Calories**: Both have 0 calories
- **Sugar**: Both have 0g sugar
- **Sodium**: Both contain approximately 40mg per 12 oz
- **Caffeine**: Diet Cherry Coke has 46mg vs Coke Zero Cherry's 34mg
- **Sweetener**: Diet Cherry Coke uses aspartame only; Coke Zero Cherry uses aspartame AND acesulfame potassium (Ace-K)

The sweetener difference is significant for some consumers. Diet Cherry Coke's single-sweetener approach (aspartame only) gives it a cleaner sweetness profile, while Coke Zero Cherry's dual-sweetener blend (aspartame + Ace-K) creates a different taste experience that some find closer to sugar.

## Price Comparison

Pricing is generally similar between the two products, though Diet Cherry Coke may carry a slight premium during its initial relaunch period:

- **12-pack cans**: Diet Cherry Coke $5.98–$7.99 vs Coke Zero Cherry $5.48–$7.49
- **20 oz bottle**: Diet Cherry Coke $2.29–$2.99 vs Coke Zero Cherry $2.19–$2.79
- **2-liter**: Diet Cherry Coke $2.28–$3.49 vs Coke Zero Cherry $1.98–$2.99
