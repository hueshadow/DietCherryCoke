## Taste Comparison

Diet Cherry Coke and Diet Dr Pepper Cherry represent two fundamentally different approaches to zero-calorie cherry soda. Understanding their base formulas is key to appreciating what makes each one unique.

**Diet Cherry Coke** starts with the classic Diet Coke formula — a crisp, clean cola with a distinctive lightness that has earned it a massive following since 1982. The cherry flavoring is layered on top of this familiar cola base, creating a straightforward cherry-cola combination. The cherry note is medium-intensity, sweet and fruity without being artificial-tasting. It is a harmonious blend where you can clearly identify both the cola and the cherry as separate but complementary flavors.

**Diet Dr Pepper Cherry** takes a completely different path. Dr Pepper's proprietary blend of 23 flavors creates a base that is far more complex than a traditional cola. It has hints of amaretto, vanilla, caramel, and spice that give it a unique character no other soda can replicate. When cherry is added to this already complex profile, the result is a layered, multidimensional taste experience. The cherry flavor weaves into the existing 23-flavor blend rather than sitting on top of it.

The mouthfeel differs as well. Diet Cherry Coke has a lighter, crisper body that finishes clean. Diet Dr Pepper Cherry feels slightly smoother and rounder on the palate, with a longer finish that lets you taste the various flavor notes as they fade. Both drinks use aspartame as their primary sweetener, but the different base formulas mean the sweetness character is distinct in each.

Carbonation levels are comparable, though some drinkers report that Diet Dr Pepper Cherry feels slightly less fizzy. Served cold from the refrigerator, both drinks are equally refreshing and satisfying.

## Nutrition Comparison

As zero-calorie beverages, Diet Cherry Coke and Diet Dr Pepper Cherry share a very similar nutritional profile. However, there are a few differences worth noting:

- **Calories**: Both have **0 calories** per 12 oz can
- **Sugar**: Both have **0g sugar**
- **Total Carbohydrates**: Both have **0g**
- **Sodium**: Diet Cherry Coke has approximately **40mg** vs Diet Dr Pepper Cherry's **55mg**
- **Caffeine**: Diet Cherry Coke has **46mg** vs Diet Dr Pepper Cherry's **41mg**
- **Sweetener**: Both use **aspartame** as the primary sweetener

The caffeine difference of 5mg per can is minor but could add up if you drink multiple cans per day. Diet Cherry Coke delivers slightly more caffeine per serving, which may appeal to those who rely on their soda for a mild energy boost. The sodium difference is more notable — Diet Dr Pepper Cherry contains about 15mg more sodium per can, which is worth considering if you are on a sodium-restricted diet.

Both beverages are free of fat, protein, and significant micronutrients. They are essentially flavored carbonated water with sweetener and caffeine. For a complete nutritional breakdown of Diet Cherry Coke, visit our [nutrition page](/nutrition).

## Price Comparison

Pricing between Diet Cherry Coke and Diet Dr Pepper Cherry is generally competitive, though regional variations and retailer-specific promotions can create temporary differences:

- **12-pack cans**: Diet Cherry Coke $5.98–$7.99 vs Diet Dr Pepper Cherry $5.48–$7.99
- **20 oz bottle**: Diet Cherry Coke $2.29–$2.99 vs Diet Dr Pepper Cherry $2.19–$2.89
- **2-liter bottle**: Diet Cherry Coke $2.28–$3.49 vs Diet Dr Pepper Cherry $1.98–$3.29

Both brands run frequent promotions, and savvy shoppers can often find buy-two-get-one deals or significant discounts when buying in bulk. Grocery store loyalty programs and digital coupons can further reduce the cost of either product.

At full retail price, the two products are close enough in cost that price should not be a deciding factor. Your choice should come down to taste preference rather than trying to save a few cents per can.

## Availability

Diet Dr Pepper Cherry has been on the market for several years and enjoys strong distribution across the United States. It is available at most major grocery chains, convenience stores, and online retailers. However, it is worth noting that Diet Dr Pepper Cherry can sometimes be harder to find than the standard Diet Dr Pepper, as retailers may not stock every variant in the Dr Pepper lineup.

Diet Cherry Coke is currently in its relaunch phase as of early 2026. Availability is expanding quickly, with confirmed distribution at Walmart, Kroger, Target, and Amazon. Some regions may have limited stock during the initial rollout period. For the most current information on where to find Diet Cherry Coke, check our [where to buy guide](/where-to-buy).

Fountain availability varies — Diet Dr Pepper Cherry appears in some fountain machines, while Diet Cherry Coke fountain distribution is still limited.

Online purchasing through Amazon, Walmart.com, and Instacart provides reliable access to both products regardless of your local store inventory.
