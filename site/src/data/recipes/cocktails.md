# 10 Best Diet Cherry Coke Cocktail Recipes

Diet Cherry Coke is not just a great soda on its own — it is also a fantastic cocktail mixer. The cherry cola flavor adds depth and sweetness to spirits without piling on the sugar and calories of traditional mixers. Whether you prefer bourbon, rum, vodka, or amaretto, there is a Diet Cherry Coke cocktail here for you.

All of these recipes are designed for a single serving and can be easily scaled up for a crowd. For the best results, always use well-chilled Diet Cherry Coke and plenty of ice.

**A note on responsibility:** These cocktails are intended for adults aged 21 and over. Please drink responsibly.

## 1. Cherry Bourbon Highball

The Cherry Bourbon Highball is the quintessential Diet Cherry Coke cocktail. The smoky sweetness of bourbon meets the bright cherry cola flavor in a drink that is effortlessly sophisticated.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 oz bourbon (such as Maker's Mark or Buffalo Trace)
- 6 oz Diet Cherry Coke
- Ice
- 1 maraschino cherry for garnish
- 1 orange slice for garnish (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a highball glass with ice.
2. Pour the bourbon over the ice.
3. Slowly top with Diet Cherry Coke, pouring down the side of the glass to preserve carbonation.
4. Stir gently once or twice.
5. Garnish with a maraschino cherry and an orange slice.

This is a crowd-pleaser at any gathering. The bourbon and cherry cola combination is a Southern classic for good reason.

## 2. Dirty Diet Cherry Coke

The Dirty Coke went viral on TikTok, and this cherry cola version takes it to the next level. The coconut cream adds a rich, tropical creaminess that transforms the drink into something truly special.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 can Diet Cherry Coke (12 oz)
- 2 tablespoons coconut cream
- 1 oz coconut rum (such as Malibu)
- Juice of half a lime
- Ice
- Lime wedge for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a tall glass with ice.
2. Add the coconut cream and coconut rum.
3. Squeeze the lime juice over the ice.
4. Pour Diet Cherry Coke slowly over the top.
5. Stir gently to combine the coconut cream throughout the drink.
6. Garnish with a lime wedge.

The coconut and cherry combination is unexpectedly delicious. For a non-alcoholic version, check out our dedicated [Dirty Diet Cherry Coke recipe](/recipes/dirty-coke).

## 3. Cherry Rum & Coke

The Rum and Coke is one of the most popular cocktails in the world, and swapping in Diet Cherry Coke gives it a fruity twist with zero added sugar.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 oz dark rum (such as Bacardi Gold or Appleton Estate)
- 6 oz Diet Cherry Coke
- Ice
- 1 lime wedge

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a rocks glass or highball glass with ice.
2. Pour the dark rum over the ice.
3. Top with Diet Cherry Coke.
4. Squeeze the lime wedge over the drink and drop it in.
5. Stir gently and serve.

Dark rum works best here because its caramel and molasses notes complement the cherry cola flavor. Avoid white rum, which can taste too sharp against the sweetness.

## 4. Cherry Vodka Fizz

Light, refreshing, and dangerously easy to drink, the Cherry Vodka Fizz is perfect for warm-weather entertaining. The vodka lets the cherry cola flavor shine through without competing for attention.

**Ingredients:**
- 1.5 oz vodka (plain or cherry-flavored)
- 4 oz Diet Cherry Coke
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- Ice
- Fresh cherry or lime wheel for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice.
2. Add the vodka and fresh lime juice.
3. Shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
4. Strain into a glass filled with fresh ice.
5. Top with Diet Cherry Coke.
6. Garnish with a fresh cherry or lime wheel.

If you use cherry-flavored vodka, you will get a more intense cherry flavor. Plain vodka keeps it lighter and more balanced. Either way, the lime juice adds a bright acidity that ties everything together.

## 5. Cherry Amaretto Sour

The Cherry Amaretto Sour is the most dessert-like cocktail on this list. Amaretto brings almond sweetness that pairs beautifully with the cherry cola, creating a drink that tastes like a cherry almond confection.

**Ingredients:**
- 1.5 oz amaretto (such as Disaronno)
- 0.5 oz bourbon
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 4 oz Diet Cherry Coke
- Ice
- Maraschino cherry and lemon twist for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a rocks glass with ice.
2. Pour the amaretto and bourbon over the ice.
3. Add the fresh lemon juice.
4. Top with Diet Cherry Coke.
5. Stir gently to combine.
6. Garnish with a maraschino cherry and a lemon twist.

The small amount of bourbon adds backbone and prevents the drink from becoming too sweet. The lemon juice provides essential acidity to balance the amaretto.

## Tips for Better Diet Cherry Coke Cocktails

**Always add the soda last.** Pour spirits and other ingredients first, then top with Diet Cherry Coke. This preserves the carbonation and keeps your drink fizzy longer.

**Use plenty of ice.** A well-iced drink stays cold longer and dilutes more slowly. Use large ice cubes when possible — they melt slower than small cubes and keep your cocktail from getting watery.

**Do not shake carbonated ingredients.** If a recipe calls for shaking, only shake the non-carbonated ingredients, then add the Diet Cherry Coke after straining into the glass.

**Chill your Diet Cherry Coke thoroughly.** Warm soda loses carbonation faster and foams up when poured. Keep your cans in the fridge for at least 24 hours before mixing.

**Garnish matters.** A maraschino cherry, lime wedge, or orange slice adds visual appeal and a subtle flavor accent. Do not skip the garnish.
