# Diet Cherry Coke Float — Classic Recipe & Variations

There is nothing quite like a classic cola float, and when you make it with Diet Cherry Coke, you get all the nostalgic flavor without the sugar overload. This recipe is ridiculously simple, endlessly customizable, and ready in under five minutes. Whether you are hosting a backyard barbecue or just treating yourself after a long day, the Diet Cherry Coke float delivers every time.

## What You Will Need

- 2 cans Diet Cherry Coke (12 oz each), well chilled
- 4 scoops vanilla ice cream (about 1/2 cup per scoop)
- Whipped cream (optional)
- Maraschino cherries for garnish

For the best results, make sure both the Diet Cherry Coke and your glasses are as cold as possible before you start. A warm glass will cause the soda to foam up too quickly and lose its fizz.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Chill your glasses.** Place two tall glasses (pint glasses or classic soda fountain glasses work best) in the freezer for at least 15 minutes before assembling.
2. **Add the ice cream.** Place two scoops of vanilla ice cream into each chilled glass. Press them down gently so they sit snugly at the bottom.
3. **Pour the Diet Cherry Coke slowly.** Tilt the glass at a slight angle and pour the Diet Cherry Coke down the side of the glass. Pour slowly to control the foam. Fill each glass about three-quarters full.
4. **Let the foam settle.** Wait about 10 seconds for the initial foam to subside, then top off with more Diet Cherry Coke if needed.
5. **Add toppings.** Add a generous swirl of whipped cream on top if desired, and finish with a maraschino cherry.
6. **Serve immediately.** Insert a long spoon and a straw, and enjoy right away while the fizz is still lively.

## Tips for the Perfect Float

**Use premium ice cream.** The quality of your ice cream matters more than you might think. A dense, full-fat vanilla ice cream creates a creamier float with better texture. Avoid low-fat or whipped varieties — they dissolve too quickly and turn the drink into a thin, foamy mess.

**Temperature is everything.** The colder your soda, the less it will foam when it hits the ice cream. Storing your Diet Cherry Coke in the fridge for at least 24 hours ensures maximum carbonation. Never use room-temperature soda.

**Pour technique matters.** Always pour the soda over the ice cream, not the other way around. Pouring slowly down the side of the glass gives you more control over the foam. If you drop ice cream into a full glass of soda, you will end up with a sticky countertop.

**Glass choice.** Tall, narrow glasses are ideal because they keep the ice cream submerged longer, giving you that perfect creamy-fizzy ratio with every sip. A classic soda fountain glass or a pint glass both work well.

**Eat it with a spoon and a straw.** The best part of a float is the interplay between the creamy ice cream and the fizzy soda. Use the spoon for the ice cream and the straw for the soda, alternating between the two.

## 3 Creative Variations

### 1. Adult Cherry Bourbon Float

Turn your float into a cocktail by adding 1.5 oz of bourbon to each glass before pouring the Diet Cherry Coke. The smoky warmth of bourbon pairs beautifully with the cherry cola flavor and the sweetness of vanilla ice cream. Top with whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup for an indulgent after-dinner treat. This variation is for adults 21 and over only.

### 2. Chocolate Cherry Float

Swap the vanilla ice cream for chocolate ice cream and add a tablespoon of chocolate syrup to each glass before pouring the Diet Cherry Coke. The combination of chocolate and cherry is a timeless pairing, and the Diet Cherry Coke adds a fizzy lift that makes it feel lighter than a traditional chocolate milkshake. Garnish with chocolate shavings and a cherry.

### 3. Strawberry Cherry Float

Use strawberry ice cream instead of vanilla and add two or three sliced fresh strawberries to each glass. The strawberry and cherry flavors complement each other perfectly, creating a fruity, refreshing float that tastes like summer. Top with whipped cream and a fresh strawberry for garnish.

## Serving Suggestions

This float is perfect as a dessert at casual gatherings, movie nights, or as an afternoon pick-me-up. Set up a float bar at your next party with Diet Cherry Coke, several ice cream flavors, and a variety of toppings so guests can build their own.

Pair your float with salty snacks like popcorn or pretzels — the contrast between sweet and salty is irresistible.
