# Dirty Diet Cherry Coke Recipe — The Viral TikTok Drink

If you have spent any time on TikTok in the last couple of years, you have almost certainly seen the Dirty Coke. This simple but genius drink took the internet by storm, and for good reason — it transforms an ordinary soda into something that tastes like it belongs on a tropical resort menu. Our version uses Diet Cherry Coke for a zero-sugar twist that is every bit as indulgent as the original.

## What Is a Dirty Coke?

A Dirty Coke is a flavored soda drink that originated at "soda shops" in Utah, where creative soda combinations have been a cultural staple for decades. The basic concept is simple: take a cola, add coconut cream (or coconut syrup), squeeze in some fresh lime, and stir. The result is a creamy, tangy, fizzy drink that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

The "dirty" in the name refers to the cloudy appearance the coconut cream gives the drink. When you pour it in and give it a stir, the clear cola turns into a beautiful, swirled, slightly opaque concoction.

The trend exploded on TikTok when creators started sharing their homemade versions, and it quickly became one of the most-searched drink recipes on the platform. Our Diet Cherry Coke version adds a fruity cherry dimension that makes it even more craveable.

## What You Will Need

- 1 can Diet Cherry Coke (12 oz), well chilled
- 2 tablespoons coconut cream (not coconut milk — you want the thick, rich cream)
- Juice of half a lime (about 1 tablespoon)
- Ice (pebble ice is ideal, but any ice works)
- Lime wedge for garnish

**Important note about coconut cream:** Coconut cream and coconut milk are not the same thing. Coconut cream is thick, rich, and almost paste-like. It is usually found in cans in the Asian foods aisle. Brands like Thai Kitchen and Aroy-D work well. Do not use the sweetened "cream of coconut" used for pina coladas — that adds unnecessary sugar and defeats the purpose of using a diet soda.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare your glass.** Choose a tall glass — a 16 oz pint glass or a mason jar works perfectly. Fill it to the top with ice. Pebble ice (the kind you get at Sonic) is the gold standard for Dirty Cokes because it chills the drink quickly and has a satisfying crunch, but standard ice cubes work fine.

2. **Add the coconut cream.** Spoon 2 tablespoons of coconut cream over the ice. It will sit on top of the ice at first, and that is exactly what you want.

3. **Squeeze in the lime.** Cut a lime in half and squeeze the juice of one half directly over the coconut cream and ice. The acidity of the lime is essential — it cuts through the richness of the coconut cream and brightens the entire drink.

4. **Pour the Diet Cherry Coke.** Open a well-chilled can of Diet Cherry Coke and pour it slowly over the ice, coconut cream, and lime juice. Pour down the side of the glass to minimize foam.

5. **Stir gently.** Use a long spoon or straw to stir the drink from the bottom up, incorporating the coconut cream throughout. You will see the drink turn from dark cola to a beautiful, cloudy, swirled appearance. Do not over-stir — some marbling looks great and the flavor will continue to mix as you drink.

6. **Garnish and serve.** Add a lime wedge to the rim of the glass and serve immediately with a straw.

## Why Did the Dirty Coke Go Viral on TikTok?

The Dirty Coke went viral for several reasons. First, it is visually stunning — the swirl of white coconut cream through dark cola is inherently satisfying to watch, which makes it perfect for short-form video. Second, the flavor combination genuinely surprises people. Most people do not expect coconut and cola to work together, but the combination is remarkably harmonious. The coconut adds a creamy, tropical richness, the lime adds brightness and acidity, and the cherry cola provides the familiar, comforting backbone.

Third, it is incredibly easy to make. There is no special equipment, no complicated technique, and no hard-to-find ingredients. Anyone can make a Dirty Coke in under three minutes with ingredients from any grocery store.

Finally, the Utah soda shop culture behind the drink gave it an interesting backstory that creators loved to share. The idea that an entire regional culture had built up around creative soda combinations was fascinating to people outside of Utah, and it drove curiosity and engagement.

## Variations to Try

### Sugar-Free Vanilla Dirty Cherry Coke

Add half a teaspoon of sugar-free vanilla syrup (such as Torani or Jordan's Skinny Syrups) along with the coconut cream. The vanilla adds a warm, dessert-like quality that makes the drink taste like a cherry vanilla cream soda. This is the most popular variation and arguably even better than the original.

### Half-and-Half Creamer Version

If you do not have coconut cream on hand, you can substitute 2 tablespoons of half-and-half or heavy cream. The flavor profile is different — less tropical, more like a classic cream soda — but it is still delicious. This version is especially good if you are not a fan of coconut.

### Oat Milk Dirty Cherry Coke

For a dairy-free and coconut-free option, use 3 tablespoons of barista-style oat milk. Oat milk has a natural sweetness and creaminess that works surprisingly well with Diet Cherry Coke. It will not be quite as rich as the coconut cream version, but it is a solid alternative.

### Spicy Dirty Cherry Coke

Add a small pinch of cayenne pepper or a few dashes of hot sauce (such as Tabasco) to the drink before stirring. The heat plays off the sweetness of the cherry cola and the richness of the coconut cream in a way that is addictive. Start with a tiny amount and adjust to your taste.

## Tips for the Best Dirty Diet Cherry Coke

**Use the coldest Diet Cherry Coke you can.** Carbonation is key to this drink, and warm soda goes flat fast. Keep your cans in the fridge, not on the counter.

**Do not skip the lime.** The lime juice is not optional. Without it, the drink is too sweet and one-dimensional. The acidity of the lime is what makes all the flavors pop.

**Pebble ice is worth seeking out.** If you have a Sonic Drive-In nearby, you can buy bags of their pebble ice. Some refrigerators also have a pebble ice setting. The texture difference is noticeable and makes the drink feel more like a treat.

**Make it a mocktail centerpiece.** This drink is perfect for parties where not everyone is drinking alcohol. It looks impressive, tastes indulgent, and has zero sugar. Set up a Dirty Coke station with Diet Cherry Coke, coconut cream, limes, and ice, and let guests make their own.
