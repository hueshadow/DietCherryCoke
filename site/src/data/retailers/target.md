## Availability Overview

Target carries Diet Cherry Coke at many of its locations, though availability is more limited compared to some larger grocery-focused retailers. Because Target stores vary significantly in size, from full-size SuperTargets with extensive grocery sections to smaller-format urban stores with curated beverage selections, the range of Diet Cherry Coke products you will find depends heavily on which Target you visit.

SuperTarget locations and larger stores with full grocery departments are your best bet for finding Diet Cherry Coke in multiple sizes. Smaller format stores may carry only single-serve bottles or 2-liters, if they stock it at all. If you have been checking [whether Diet Cherry Coke is back](/is-it-back) in your area, Target's inventory can be somewhat inconsistent, so verifying stock before your trip is strongly recommended.

The good news is that Target's app and website make it easy to check real-time inventory at your local store, so you never have to make a wasted trip.

## Pricing & Sizes

Target's pricing on Diet Cherry Coke falls in a competitive middle range among major retailers:

- **12-Pack of 12 oz Cans**: Typically $6.29 to $7.49, depending on whether a promotion is active.
- **2-Liter Bottle**: Usually $2.19 to $2.49 at regular price.
- **20 oz Single Bottle**: Around $2.29 to $2.59, available in the grab-and-go refrigerated section near checkout.
- **Mini Cans (10-Pack of 7.5 oz)**: Priced around $5.99 to $6.79 when available.
- **8-Pack of 12 oz Cans**: Some Target locations carry this mid-size option for approximately $4.99 to $5.49.

Target does not always have the absolute lowest everyday price on Diet Cherry Coke, but their promotional pricing and Circle offers can make them very competitive. During holiday weekends and summer months, Target frequently runs beverage promotions that bring 12-pack prices down to the $5 to $6 range.

## Target Circle Offers & Savings

Target Circle is Target's free loyalty program, and it is one of the best ways to save on Diet Cherry Coke purchases. Here is how to take advantage of it:

**Target Circle Membership**: Signing up is free and gives you access to personalized deals, a birthday reward, and the ability to earn Target Circle earnings on every purchase. These earnings translate into future savings at checkout.

**Circle Offers**: The Target app regularly features Circle offers on Coca-Cola products. These might include percentage-off deals on 12-packs, dollar-off coupons on multipacks, or buy-one-get-one promotions. You need to add these offers to your account before checkout for them to apply.

**Target Circle Card**: If you have a Target Circle debit or credit card (formerly the Target REDcard), you automatically save 5% on nearly every purchase, including Diet Cherry Coke. This stacks with Circle offers, making it one of the most effective ways to reduce your grocery bill at Target.

**Gift Card Promotions**: Target periodically runs promotions where you receive a Target gift card when you buy a certain number of Coca-Cola products. For example, buy three 12-packs and get a $5 Target gift card. These deals appear in the weekly ad and in the Target app.

## How to Find It In-Store

In Target stores, Diet Cherry Coke is located in the grocery and beverage section. In larger stores, this is a dedicated grocery area with full aisles of soft drinks. In smaller format stores, the beverage selection may be condensed into a single aisle or a few shelves.

Look for Diet Cherry Coke near other Coca-Cola products. It is typically shelved alongside Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, and Coke Zero Sugar. If you do not see it on the main shelf, check any endcap displays in the beverage area, as promotional items are often placed there.

The Target app is extremely helpful for locating products in-store. Search for Diet Cherry Coke, select your store, and the app will show you the exact aisle location. It will also indicate whether the item is currently in stock, which can save you a trip if your store happens to be out.

## Drive Up & Same-Day Delivery

Target offers some of the most convenient shopping options for picking up Diet Cherry Coke without entering the store:

**Target Drive Up**: This free service lets you order through the Target app and pick up your items without leaving your car. After placing your order, drive to your Target store, tap "I'm on my way" in the app, and park in a designated Drive Up spot. A Target team member will bring your order to your car, usually within a few minutes. There is no minimum order required, and the service is available at nearly all Target locations.

**Order Pickup**: If you prefer to walk into the store, you can place an order through the app and pick it up at the service desk. This is a good option if you want to browse the store but also want to guarantee that your Diet Cherry Coke is set aside for you.

**Same-Day Delivery via Shipt**: Target owns Shipt, a same-day delivery service. You can order Diet Cherry Coke through the Target app or Shipt app and have it delivered to your door in as little as one hour. Delivery fees apply unless you have a Shipt membership or Target Circle 360 membership, which includes unlimited free same-day delivery on orders of $35 or more.

**Standard Shipping**: For non-perishable items like canned Diet Cherry Coke, Target offers standard shipping to your home. Free shipping is available on orders of $35 or more for Target Circle members.

## Tips for Shoppers

1. **Check the App Before You Go**: Target's inventory system is generally accurate. A quick search in the app will tell you if Diet Cherry Coke is in stock at your store and where to find it.
2. **Stack Circle Offers with Your Circle Card**: The 5% Circle Card discount applies on top of Circle offers, giving you a double discount on Diet Cherry Coke.
3. **Watch for Gift Card Promotions**: These are some of the best deals Target offers on beverages. Buying in bulk during a gift card promotion effectively lowers your per-unit cost significantly.
4. **Use Drive Up for Convenience**: If you just need Diet Cherry Coke and a few other items, Drive Up is faster than walking through the store and waiting in a checkout line.
5. **Try Smaller Format Stores for Quick Trips**: If you live near a small-format Target, they often have refrigerated single-serve Diet Cherry Coke near the entrance, perfect for grabbing on the go.
